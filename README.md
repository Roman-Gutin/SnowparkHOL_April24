There are two main prerequisites for getting started with Snowpark.
Using Third-Party Packages from Anaconda

Before you start using the packages provided by Anaconda inside Snowflake, you must acknowledge the External Offerings Terms.
Note
You must be the organization administrator (use the ORGADMIN role) to accept the terms. You only need to accept the terms once for your Snowflake account. See Enabling the ORGADMIN role in an account.
Sign in to Snowsight.
Select Admin Â» Billing & Terms.
In the Anaconda section, select Enable.
In the Anaconda Packages dialog, click the link to review the External Offerings Terms page.
If you agree to the terms, select Acknowledge & Continue.
If you see an error when attempting to accept the terms of service, your user profile might be missing a first name, last name, or email address. If you have an administrator role, refer to Add user details to your user profile to update your profile using Snowsight. Otherwise, contact an administrator to update your account.
